Inside the splendid hall, over a hundred people crowded around a large screen suspended in the air.

“This newbie sure is unlucky.”

“He actually challenged a veteran without undergoing the beginner’s training.”

“All newbies are like that. They think that they can defeat Violent Bear just because they are strong in their own Guilds. Does he really think the Battle Points are that easy to earn?”

Everyone began to chat merrily as they watched the screen. Such fights had become entertainment to flavor their lives.

As for a newcomer’s chances of defeating these veterans?

Their only answer was a meaningful “Hehe.”

“Sure enough, Violent Bear is bullying another newbie. He only recently finished conning the last one, and he’s already at it again,” Kong Haoran sighed ruefully when he noticed another battle brewing.

“Didn’t they say that it was the newcomer who challenged that Violent Bear fellow? Why would you say that he’s conning the newcomer?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

“It’s like this: while newcomers only have 100 Battle Points, Violent Bear will gamble 500 Battle Points. Almost everyone who has come here is a top-class expert in their own Guild. Either that, or they are people with vast potential. Such people are typically quite confident of their strength,” Kong Haoran explained. “However, they have forgotten that the Secret Pavilion’s experts aren’t ordinary either. Only the Pavilion’s leading fighters can earn a slot in this training system.”

“There is a huge possibility that these people will become members of the Secret Pavilion’s middle management in the future. Moreover, even before they entered this training system, they were all strong enough to be top-class experts in any first-rate Guild. After training in here for over a month, their combat standards have grown significantly.

“Violent Bear is quite strong. Among the 350 training members, he ranks 141th. Newcomers shouldn’t try to provoke him.”

Shi Feng agreed with Kong Haoran.

In God’s Domain, first-rate Guilds and Super Guilds lived in two, completely different worlds. A player known as a genius in a first-rate Guild might just be an extra in a Super Guild. In fact, the majority of the most outstanding newcomers each year were either from Super Guilds or super-first-rate Guilds.

Even if an outstanding newcomer emerged in a first-rate Guild, it would be due to their innate frightening talent alone. Gentle Snow would be one such example.

“This is interesting,” Shi Feng muttered, smiling as he watched at the image on the screen.

On the large screen, a man taller and more robust than even Cola stood to one side. The man wielded a battle axe and had chosen the Berserker class. Meanwhile, Shi Feng recognized the man standing across from the Berserker; it was the Elementalist Red Feather from the Star Alliance. Red Feather looked exactly as he did in God’s Domain. It was clear that he had not modified his appearance when he had joined God’s Domain, unlike Shi Feng, who looked quite different in God’s Domain.

In the recent update of the God’s Domain Experts List, Red Feather had been ranked 934th. Although his rank had fallen slightly due to the emergence of new experts, he should not be underestimated.

The simulation training system mimicked God’s Domain’s classes to near-perfection. However, in the training system, everyone’s Basic Attributes were normalized and their Levels set to 30. Their equipment did not provide any additional Attributes either, and the Skills they possessed were limited to their class’s Basic Skills. There were no special Skills in this system. The fights here relied on one’s techniques.

As soon as the battle began, Red Feather launched a fierce assault on Violent Bear, using Frost Arrows to attack and Ice Walls or Ice Spheres to hinder the Berserker’s movements. Ordinary experts would not be able to cope with such a two-pronged approach.

However, Violent Bear remained unperturbed. Not only could he easily evade the Frost Arrows, but he had also utilized his evasive maneuvers to shorten the distance between himself and the enemy Elementalist. This situation forced Red Feather to retreat repeatedly.

In just ten seconds, Red Feather had lost half his HP. In contrast, Violent Bear had only lost around 10% from blocking a few Frost Arrows and Fireballs with his axe. Moreover, Red Feather had exhausted his Blink charges and was now at the Berserker’s mercy.

In Shi Feng’s opinion, Red Feather had performed quite well. If he had faced an ordinary expert, he would have long since emerged victorious due to his unending assault and Ice Walls. Unfortunately, Violent Bear was no ordinary expert.

Ordinary experts lacked sufficient physical control. Against Red Feather’s attacks, they would busy themselves with dodging and blocking. Violent Bear, on the other hand, had excellent control over his body. He could make the necessary movements during crucial moments, easily avoiding Red Feather’s accurate attacks while closing in on his enemy, slowly, but surely, forcing the Elementalist into a corner.

Even before the battle had begun, the outcome had been determined.

Red Feather currently had yet to reach the Half-step Refinement Realm. He simply stood no chance against Violent Bear, someone who had reached the Refinement Realm. The difference between their combat techniques was like the difference between heaven and earth. With both sides having equal Attributes and no special Skills or tools, Red Feather had no chance of winning.

Sure enough, in less than half a minute, Violent Bear approached Red Feather with a Charge and claimed the Elementalist’s life with a Whirlwind Slash.

“Hahaha! Little noob, consider the 100 points you’ve lost as a tuition fee. When you have points again, I welcome a rematch.” The man known as Violent Bear smirked at the angry Red Feather disdainfully after teleporting back to the main hall. He then turned around and exclaimed, “Ah, this feels great! With these 100 points, I can face a decent opponent again.”

“You…”

Red Feather wanted to charge at the Berserker. However, Purple Eye held him back.

“Red, you’re no match for him right now. He has already reached that realm,” Purple Eye advised sternly, her voice containing both helplessness and excitement.

Although she was slightly stronger than Red Feather, her strength was limited. There was still a massive gap between herself and Violent Bear.

In the past few years, she had followed Galaxy Past around and had defeated many well-known experts. She acknowledged that she had improved significantly since leaving her Super Guild. However, she had never imagined that she would still suffer defeat against the internal experts that God’s Domain’s major powers nurtured.

Refinement Realm experts, which were extremely rare in God’s Domain, were abundant here…

Yet, even a Refinement Realm expert like Violent Bear only ranked 141th here. Purple Eye finally understood just how terrifying the virtual gaming world’s giants were. What she had seen in the past had only been the tip of the iceberg.

As Violent Bear approached the exchange counter, his gaze landed on Shi Feng. He immediately walked up to the Swordsman, smiling brightly as he said, “Oh? I’ve never seen you before. You must be new to the training system, right? Interested in a match against me? If I win, I want your 100 points. If you win, I’ll give you 500. What do you think?

“I’ll teach you how precious the Battle Points here are. Those ranked beyond 300th place only get 20 points each day; 50 points if you rank between 201st and 300th, 100 points if you rank between 151st and 200th, 200 points if you rank between 101st and 150th, and 300 points if you rank between 51st and 100th. And don’t even dream of reaching the top 50 ranks.

“How about it? With 500 points, you can spar against top-tier experts for an entire day.”

Kong Haoran stepped forward and growled, “Violent Bear, that’s enough of you.”
