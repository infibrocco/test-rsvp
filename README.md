# Just a text reader that tries to be a bit fast and useable

I made this prototype text reader for myself (taking inspiration from SwiftRead chrome extension among other "speed readers") for reading some long text a bit faster (from ~500wpm to ~800wpm).
This code is extremely unpolished, has nonsensical variable naming, and is completely undocumented and mostly untested. This should not have been dumped to GitHub but it has because I fear drive failure.

Someone told me this reader might be unnecessary since you can *just move your eyes faster*. To that, I say, why depend on fast eye movement?
I'm no opthalmologist or optometrist but I think that words flying across the screen are more fun to read than moving your eyes that much.
Also, this approach ([Rapid serial visual presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation)) may make [peripheral reading](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/language-language-arts/reading/speed-reading-in-clumps-by-using-your-peripheral-vision-193382/) easier.

I might refactor this code. Or rather, rewrite it all using a different gui library.
